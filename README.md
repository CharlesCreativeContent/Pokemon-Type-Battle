## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the changing of the source of an image element, and techniques to make a standard size for non-standard images. Workd very well for desktop, but the mobile version still needs some media qeuries

## Optimizations

I would have made a container for the objects that could have resized each image automatically rather than writing a function that updates the size and location after rendering. It got the job done, but was overly cumbersome to update and add more features. Would seriously think about optimizing the code before launching the second version of this game, which will feature a hard-mode that includes all the pokemon types. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that when I am writing custom functions and corrections for each individual element, I should definitely keep an eye out for techniques, strategies, or, frameworks, that could make my work more scalable and optimized.
